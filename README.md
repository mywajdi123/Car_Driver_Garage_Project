# Car_Driver_Garage_Project


Car Driver Program Function(Part 1/2):
This program can calculate the amount of fuel used and the actual distance driven in the drive() method. 
The algorithm implemented use's multiple formulas (as a piecewise function) that gives proportionately poorer mileage when the Car is driven faster or slower than its optimal speed. 


Garage Driver Function (Part 2/2:
This program is used to create a Garage class to store Cars. The Garage object is an instantiation of a Garage class that contains “parking”, an array of the Car class.

Detail of Program Functions:
- The size of the garage is specified by the user.
- The user may only use cars from the garage
- A Car is removed from the Garage when a user retrieves a Car from the Garage.
- The Car is returned to the Garage, after it is driven.
- The user interacts with the Car object after the Car object is retrieved from the garage.
- A car may only be refueled while in the Garage
- The user may select to drive any car that is currently in the garage
- The user is the only one that may request that a car be refueled.
